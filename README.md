# ðŸŽ¯ Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction-
This project explores the application of machine learning to classify rocks and mines underwater using sonar data. It aims to improve submarine navigation safety and reduce collision risks by developing a model to distinguish between these objects based on sonar signal features.

# ðŸ›’Libraries used for this project:

**numpy as np:** This line imports the NumPy library, which is commonly used for scientific computing and array manipulation in Python.

**pandas as pd**: This line imports the Pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation in Python. It provides data structures and operations specifically designed for working with tabular data.

**from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split:** This line imports the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library. This function is used to split a dataset into training and testing sets for machine learning models.

**from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression:** This line imports the LogisticRegression class from the scikit-learn library. This class is used to implement the logistic regression algorithm, which is a machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary classification problems.

**from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score:** This line imports the accuracy_score function from the scikit-learn library. This function is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by calculating its accuracy.

# ðŸ“‹Let's delve into the steps involved:

âœ…**1. Data Loading:**
The code likely includes a step to load the sonar data using Pandas. This would involve reading the data from a CSV file or another data source into a Pandas DataFrame.

âœ…**2. Data Pre-processing:**
Before feeding the data to our machine learning model, we need to ensure it's clean and ready for analysis. This might involve:

**Handling missing values:**
Techniques like mean imputation or deletion can be used to fill in missing data points.

**Outlier detection:** Identifying and potentially removing data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

**Data normalization:** Scaling the data to a common range can improve the performance of machine learning models.

âœ…**3. Train-Test Split Teaching the Model:**

The train_test_split function is used to split the pre-processed data into two sets: training and testing. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, allowing it to learn the patterns that differentiate rocks and mines in sonar data. The testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

âœ…**4. Model Training:**

For this project, we'll utilize logistic regression, a robust machine learning algorithm particularly well-suited for binary classification problems like rock vs. mine. By analyzing the training data, the model learns to identify features that are most indicative of a rock or a mine.

âœ…**5. Evaluation:**

Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing set. In this project, we achieved an accuracy of 76.19%. This means that the model correctly classified approximately 76.2% of the objects (rocks or mines) in the testing data. Metrics like precision and recall can be used for further analysis.

Overall, the code snippet depicts a typical workflow for building a machine learning model for binary classification using Python libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn. In this specific case, the goal is to classify rocks and mines underwater using sonar data.
